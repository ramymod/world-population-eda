# 🌍 World Population - EDA Project

This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the world population dataset using Python, Pandas, and Seaborn.

## 📊 Objectives

- Understand global population distribution
- Identify top populous countries
- Analyze growth rates across continents
- Visualize key metrics using plots

## 📦 Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle - World Population](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/world-population-dataset)

## 📈 Key Visualizations

- Barplot of top 10 populous countries
- Pie chart of population by continent
- Growth rate boxplot by region
- Scatter plot of Area vs Density

## 📌 Insights

- China and India alone account for more than 35% of the global population.
- Africa has the highest growth rate among continents.
- Some countries have high density despite small area (e.g. Bangladesh).
